Rabbit Hole Art Simulation
Rabbit Hole Painting

Overview
This Python script aims to simulate the artistic style of Jackson Pollock, one of the most renowned abstract artists known for creating visually captivating artworks that appear to be the result of random chance. The specific artwork we aim to simulate is "Rabbit Hole," an example of Pollock's distinctive abstract expressionist style.

The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether it's possible to recreate the unique randomness and chaotic patterns found in Pollock's paintings using a deterministic system. By employing Python's Turtle graphics library, we generate abstract art that closely resembles Pollock's work while acknowledging the underlying algorithms and controlled randomness used in the process.

Key Features
Concentric Circles: The code generates concentric circles, each starting in the middle of the canvas, with inner circles perfectly centered within their outer counterparts.

Random Color Palette: A wide range of colors are randomly selected by extracting the same colors from the original Rabbit Hole painting by using colorgram.This was done seperately and the outputs of the list of colors was saved in a list and the rest of the code was deleted to optimize and increase efficiency of the code.

Dynamic Circle Spacing: The spacing between concentric circles is determined randomly, adding an element of unpredictability to the composition.

Random Dots: Randomly placed dots with varying colors and sizes enhance the visual complexity and chaotic feel of the artwork.

Circular Walks: Circular movements are introduced to the artwork, creating random circular patterns within the canvas.

Chaos and Determinism: The project explores the tension between chaos and determinism in art creation, showcasing how a deterministic system can mimic the appearance of randomness.

Usage
To run the script and generate your own Pollock-inspired artwork, follow these steps:

Install Python on your computer if it's not already installed.

Make sure you have the Turtle graphics library, which is typically included with Python. If you don't have it, you may need to install it separately.

Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., rabbit_hole_art.py).

Run the script using your preferred Python environment.

If you want to compare the simulation with the original painting it is inside the Rabbit Hole project folder which is named jackson_pollock.jpeg

Observe the abstract artwork generated on the Turtle graphics canvas. You can adjust the number of concentric circles, circle radius, and other parameters to experiment with different results.

Inspiration
This project is inspired by Jackson Pollock's unique artistic approach and aims to explore the boundary between true randomness and controlled chaos in art creation. By leveraging Python and Turtle graphics, it showcases how digital tools can be used to simulate Pollock's iconic style and generate abstract art that captures the essence of "Rabbit Hole" and other famous works.
